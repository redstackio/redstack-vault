# KC1

**Description**: test

## Overview

This attack chain consists of 4 steps.

## Attack Steps

### Step 1: Thorough Port Scan with Service Enumeration

**Procedure**: [[Thorough Port Scan with Service Enumeration]]

> Query a computer's services by probing the ports on which it listens. Since each system potentially has 65,535 ports for TCP and UDP, it's often best to perform multiple scans, each focusing on a different technique or port range.

### Step 2: Thorough Port Scan with Service Enumeration

**Procedure**: [[Thorough Port Scan with Service Enumeration]]

> Query a computer's services by probing the ports on which it listens. Since each system potentially has 65,535 ports for TCP and UDP, it's often best to perform multiple scans, each focusing on a different technique or port range.

### Step 3: Upgrade from a Website RCE to Reverse Shell (Linux)

**Procedure**: [[Upgrade from a Website RCE to Reverse Shell (Linux)]]

> In cases where Remote Code Execution (RCE) is achieved on a web application, the next step is usually to launch a reverse shell for terminal access. This procedure will outline a few common approaches. 

---

### Step 4: Enumerate a Web CMS for Usernames and Passwords

**Procedure**: [[Enumerate a Web CMS for Usernames and Passwords]]

> Many websites reveal usernames and potential passwords in the pages themselves, hidden files, and configuration files. By enumerating a site's content with tools, username and password lists can be generated and used for login brute forcing.
