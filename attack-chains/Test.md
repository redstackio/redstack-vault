# Test

## Overview

This attack chain consists of 2 steps.

## Attack Steps

### Step 1: Sniff Unencrypted LDAP Queries via the Loopback

**Procedure**: [[Sniff Unencrypted LDAP Queries via the Loopback]]

> Some versions of LDAP send unencrypted queries over the loopback address. If an attacker is able to sniff traffic locally while LDAP requests are being generated, it may be possible to intercept plaintext credentials.

### Step 2: Sniff Unencrypted LDAP Queries via the Loopback

**Procedure**: [[Sniff Unencrypted LDAP Queries via the Loopback]]

> Some versions of LDAP send unencrypted queries over the loopback address. If an attacker is able to sniff traffic locally while LDAP requests are being generated, it may be possible to intercept plaintext credentials.
