# Server-Side Request Forgery via WSGI Gopher Protocol Exploit

## Summary

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send unauthenticated requests from a vulnerable web application. WSGI Gopher Protocol Exploit is a type of SSRF exploit that abuses the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) protocol to make requests to internal resource

## Description

# Description

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send unauthenticated requests from a vulnerable web application. WSGI Gopher Protocol Exploit is a type of SSRF exploit that abuses the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) protocol to make requests to internal resources. This technique can be used by attackers to bypass network security measures and access sensitive data. To execute this exploit, an attacker sends a specially crafted request to the vulnerable web application, which then forwards the request to the internal server via the WSGI protocol. The internal server processes the request and sends the response back to the vulnerable web application, which then forwards it back to the attacker. This allows the attacker to access internal resources that are not directly accessible from the internet.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to a vulnerable web application that uses the WSGI protocol

 

## Defense

1. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent untrusted inputs from being processed by the web application

1. Configure firewalls to restrict access to internal resources

1. Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, such as requests to internal resources from external sources

 

## Objectives

1. Accessing sensitive data from internal resources

1. Bypassing network security measures

 

# Instructions

1. The Gopher Protocol Exploit allows attackers to remotely execute code on a vulnerable server by exploiting a weakness in the uWSGI application server. To use this exploit, simply provide the target server's IP address and the path to the malicious Python script.

 



**Code**: [[gopher://localhost:8000/_%00%1A%00%00%0A%00UWSGI_F]]



> The 'data' field in this JSON object contains the payload that will be sent to the vulnerable server via the Gopher protocol. The 'lang' field specifies that the payload is in PowerShell format. The 'text' field provides additional information about the exploit, including a link to the full exploit script on GitHub. The 'instruction' field provides step-by-step instructions for using the exploit, while the 'explain' field provides a more detailed explanation of how the exploit works and what it can be used for.
