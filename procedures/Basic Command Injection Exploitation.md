# Description

Basic Command Injection is a technique where an attacker injects malicious code into a command that is executed by the system. This can be done through input fields on a web application or other vulnerable software. The attacker can then execute any command on the system with the privileges of the vulnerable process. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.

From a technical perspective, this attack works by appending additional commands to the original command that is executed by the system. This can be done by using special characters that allow for command chaining, such as semicolons or ampersands. For example, an attacker could inject the command 'ls; rm -rf /' into a vulnerable input field. This would cause the system to execute the 'ls' command, followed by the 'rm -rf /' command, which would delete all files on the system.

The business value of this attack is that it allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system and potentially steal sensitive information or disrupt operations.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to a vulnerable input field or other vulnerable software that allows for command injection

 

## Defense

1. Input validation and sanitization should be performed on all user input to prevent injection attacks

1. Access controls should be in place to limit the privileges of vulnerable processes

1. Monitoring and logging should be implemented to detect and respond to potential injection attacks

 

## Objectives

1. Execute arbitrary commands on the target system

1. Gain unauthorized access to the target system

 

# Instructions

1. Copy and paste the command into the vulnerable input field or other vulnerable software.

 



**Code**: [[cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
da]]



> This command will execute the 'cat /etc/passwd' command, which will display the contents of the /etc/passwd file. This file contains information about user accounts on the system.



**Command** ([[Display Password File]]):

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```
