## Description

# Description

Exploiting a CORS misconfiguration is a technique used to bypass the same-origin policy implemented by web browsers. This allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests to a victim's web application, which can lead to sensitive data exposure or unauthorized actions. The technique involves sending a specially crafted request to the victim's web application, which includes the attacker's domain in the 'Origin' header. If the victim's web application is misconfigured, it will respond with a 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header that allows the attacker's domain to access the response. This can be used to steal sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to a web application with a CORS misconfiguration

 

## Defense

1. Ensure that CORS is properly configured on your web application, including the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header

1. Implement strict input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks that can be used to inject the attacker's payload

1. Implement rate limiting and other security controls to prevent brute force attacks that could exploit a CORS misconfiguration

 

## Objectives

1. Exploit a CORS misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access to a victim's web application

1. Steal sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim

 

# Instructions

1. Send the above payload to the victim's web application, replacing 'https://victim.example.com/endpoint' with the target API endpoint and 'https://attacker.com' with your own domain.

 



**Code**: [[https://victim.example.com/endpoint]]



> The payload sends a cross-origin request to the victim's web application, including the attacker's domain in the 'Origin' header. If the victim's web application is misconfigured, it will respond with an 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header that allows the attacker's domain to access the response. The response is then logged to the console for the attacker to view.



**Command** ([[Access URL]]):

```bash
https://victim.example.com/endpoint
```
