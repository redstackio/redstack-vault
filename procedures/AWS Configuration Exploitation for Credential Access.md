## Description

# Description

AWS Configuration Exploitation for Credential Access is a technique used by attackers to gain access to sensitive information stored in AWS. Attackers can exploit misconfigured AWS services or weak access controls to gain access to AWS resources and steal credentials. This technique can be used to gain access to sensitive data stored in AWS, such as customer data, financial data, and intellectual property.

To exploit AWS Configuration for Credential Access, the attacker needs to have knowledge of AWS services and access to the AWS environment. The attacker can use various tools and techniques to exploit misconfigured AWS services or weak access controls. Once the attacker gains access to AWS resources, they can steal credentials and use them to gain further access to the targeted environment.

The business value of this technique is that it allows attackers to gain access to sensitive data stored in AWS, which can be used for financial gain or to gain a competitive advantage.

## Requirements

1. Access to the AWS environment

## Defense

1. Ensure that AWS services are properly configured and access controls are in place

1. Use multi-factor authentication to protect AWS credentials

1. Monitor AWS logs for suspicious activity

## Objectives

1. Gain access to sensitive data stored in AWS

# Instructions

1. This command is used to configure the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) on your local machine. It will prompt you to enter the AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

The arguments for this command are:

1. AWS Access Key ID: This is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate your AWS account. You can obtain this key from the AWS Management Console.

2. AWS Secret Access Key: This is a secret key that is used to authenticate your AWS account. You can obtain this key from the AWS Management Console.

3. Default region name: This is the default AWS region that will be used by the AWS CLI. If you do not specify a region in your command, the AWS CLI will use this default region.

4. Default output format: This is the default output format that the AWS CLI will use to display its output. You can choose from several formats including JSON, text, and table.

**Command** ([[AWS CLI Configuration]]):

```bash
aws configure
```
