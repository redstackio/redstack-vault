## Description

# Description

GitHack is a tool that exploits insecurely configured Git repositories. By cloning the repository and searching for sensitive information, such as passwords, keys, and credentials, an attacker can gain access to the target's system. This tool can be used to gain initial access, execute code, and maintain persistence. The business value of this attack is that it can lead to a full compromise of the target's system and data theft.

From a technical perspective, GitHack uses the Git protocol to clone the repository and searches for sensitive information in the source code. It can also recover deleted files and perform other actions on the repository. The tool is simple to use and requires minimal technical knowledge.

The objectives of this procedure are to gain access to a target's system, exfiltrate sensitive data, and maintain persistence.

## Requirements

1. Access to the target's Git repository

1. Knowledge of the target's source code management practices

1. GitHack tool

## Defense

1. Ensure that Git repositories are not publicly accessible

1. Implement access controls and authentication mechanisms for Git repositories

1. Monitor Git repositories for unauthorized access and activity

## Objectives

1. Gain initial access to the target's system

1. Exfiltrate sensitive data

1. Maintain persistence

# Instructions

1. 1. Clone the repository using the following command:

   git clone https://github.com/lijiejie/GitHack

2. Navigate to the GitHack directory.

3. Run the GitHack.py script, providing the URL of the target's Git repository as an argument.

   GitHack.py http://web.site/.git/

**Code**: [[git clone https://github.com/lijiejie/GitHack
GitH]]

> The 'git clone' command clones the GitHack repository from GitHub. The 'GitHack.py' script is then run, providing the URL of the target's Git repository as an argument. The script will search for sensitive information in the repository, including passwords, keys, and credentials. It can also recover deleted files and perform other actions on the repository.

**Command** ([[Clone GitHack repository]]):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lijiejie/GitHack
```

**Command** ([[Run GitHack script]]):

```bash
GitHack.py http://web.site/.git/
```
