# HockeyApp API Token Exploitation

## Summary

HockeyApp is a platform for managing, distributing, and beta testing mobile apps. It provides APIs to interact with the platform, and these APIs require authentication tokens to access them. If these tokens are leaked or exposed, an attacker can use them to access sensitive data or perform actions 

## Description

# Description

HockeyApp is a platform for managing, distributing, and beta testing mobile apps. It provides APIs to interact with the platform, and these APIs require authentication tokens to access them. If these tokens are leaked or exposed, an attacker can use them to access sensitive data or perform actions on behalf of the account owner. This procedure outlines how to exploit a leaked HockeyApp API token.

## Requirements

1. Access to a leaked HockeyApp API token.

## Defense

1. Regularly rotate API tokens to limit the impact of a leaked token.

1. Implement access controls to limit the actions that can be performed with an API token.

1. Monitor API usage for suspicious activity or unauthorized access.

## Objectives

1. To gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and/or perform unauthorized actions on the HockeyApp account.

# Instructions

1. Replace the API token and app ID in the command with the leaked token and the ID of the app you want to access.

**Code**: [[curl -H "X-HockeyAppToken: ad136912c642076b0d1f32b]]

> This command uses the curl utility to make a request to the HockeyApp API using the leaked API token. It specifies the token in the request header, and requests information about the app with the specified ID. An attacker can modify this command to perform other actions on the account, such as uploading or deleting apps.

**Command** ([[Retrieve HockeyApp Application Details]]):

```bash
curl -H "X-HockeyAppToken: ad136912c642076b0d1f32ba161f1846b2c" https://rink.hockeyapp.net/api/2/apps/2021bdf2671ab09174c1de5ad147ea2ba4
