3. In the response from step 2 , notice that the customTemplate class contains destruct() magic method . This will invoke the u*nlink()* method on the *lock_file_path *attribute which will delete the file on this path.

4. In Burp Decoder, use the correct syntax for serialized PHP data to create a CustomTemplate object with the lock_file_path attribute set to /home/carlos/morale.txt. 

Make sure to use the correct data type labels and length indicators. 

The final object looks like this:
* O:14:"CustomTemplate":1:{s:14:"lock_file_path";s:23:"/home/carlos/morale.txt";}*



Base64 and URL encode this object and save it to your clipboard.

5. Send a request containing the session cookie to Burp Repeater.

        In Burp Repeater, replace the session cookie with the modified one in your clipboard.

        Send the request. The __destruct()magic method is automatically invoked and will delete Carlos's file.
