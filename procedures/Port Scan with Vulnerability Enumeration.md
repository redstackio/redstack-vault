# Port Scan with Vulnerability Enumeration

**Status**: ✓ Verified

## Summary

Perform an Nmap port scan of a target's ports and enumerate with Nmap's "vuln" scripts, enumerating services for popular CVEs and misconfigurations. For a list of all scripts which are run, see the Nmap website. 

## Description

# Description

Perform an Nmap port scan of a target's ports and enumerate with Nmap's "vuln" scripts, enumerating services for popular CVEs and misconfigurations. For a list of all scripts which are run, see the [Nmap website](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/vuln.html).

# Instructions

**Command** ([[Nmap Port Scan with Vuln Scripts]]):

```bash
nmap -script vuln $_TARGET_IP
```

Note: this scan may take a while when scanning multiple services and is it noisy. It may be preferable to perform an initial scan to identify services, then scan specific high value services (HTTP, SSH, SMB, etc) using 'vuln' scripts along with the "-p" argument and a comma separated list of ports.
