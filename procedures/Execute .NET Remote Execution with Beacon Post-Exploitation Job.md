# Execute .NET Remote Execution with Beacon Post-Exploitation Job

## Summary

This procedure utilizes Cobalt Strike's Beacon post-exploitation job to execute a .NET program remotely. The attacker can use PowerShell to load the .NET program into memory and execute it on the target machine. This allows the attacker to bypass traditional security measures and execute code witho

## Description

# Description

This procedure utilizes Cobalt Strike's Beacon post-exploitation job to execute a .NET program remotely. The attacker can use PowerShell to load the .NET program into memory and execute it on the target machine. This allows the attacker to bypass traditional security measures and execute code without touching the disk. The .NET remote execution technique is particularly useful for lateral movement and privilege escalation. By using the Beacon post-exploitation job, the attacker can maintain persistence on the target machine.

## Requirements

1. Access to a Cobalt Strike server

1. Beacon post-exploitation job

1. PowerShell

## Defense

1. Monitor network traffic for suspicious PowerShell activity

1. Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect and prevent malicious .NET remote execution

1. Implement least privilege access controls to limit the impact of an attack

## Objectives

1. Execute a .NET program remotely

1. Bypass traditional security measures

1. Maintain persistence on the target machine

# Instructions

1. To run a .NET program as a Beacon post-exploitation job, use the 'execute-assembly' command followed by the path to the executable and any necessary arguments. For example:
beacon > execute-assembly /home/user/program.exe arg1 arg2

**Code**: [[beacon > execute-assembly [/path/to/script.exe] [a]]

> This command allows a user to run a local .NET executable on a compromised system as a Beacon post-exploitation job. The 'execute-assembly' command is used to specify the path to the executable and any necessary arguments. Once executed, the Beacon will run the program and send the output back to the user. This can be useful for performing various tasks on a compromised system, such as privilege escalation or data exfiltration.
