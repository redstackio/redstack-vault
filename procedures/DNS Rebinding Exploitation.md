# DNS Rebinding Exploitation

## Summary

This technique involves the attacker setting up a malicious DNS server and then tricking the victim's browser into making requests to the attacker's 

## Description

# Description

DNS Rebinding is a technique that allows an attacker to bypass the same-origin policy of web browsers and access resources that should be restricted. This technique involves the attacker setting up a malicious DNS server and then tricking the victim's browser into making requests to the attacker's server. By doing this, the attacker can access resources that should only be available to the victim's browser. This technique can be used to steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

To exploit a vulnerable service with DNS Rebinding, we need to make sure that the targeted service is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. It can be done with a simple curl request that includes an arbitrary hostname in the Host header and the IP address of the vulnerable service in the URL.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to a vulnerable service

1. Knowledge of the IP address of the vulnerable service

 

## Defense

1. Configure firewalls and DNS servers to block traffic from untrusted sources

1. Implement strict same-origin policies in web applications

1. Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity

 

## Objectives

1. Exploit a vulnerable service using DNS Rebinding

1. Gain access to resources that should be restricted

 

# Instructions

1. Replace <arbitrary-hostname> with any hostname of your choice and <vulnerable-service> with the IP address of the vulnerable service.

 



**Code**: [[curl --header 'Host: <arbitrary-hostname>' http://]]



> This command will send a request to the vulnerable service with the specified Host header. If the service is vulnerable to DNS Rebinding, it will accept the request and return a response. If the service is not vulnerable, it will reject the request.



**Command** ([[Curl Command]]):

```bash
curl --header 'Host: <arbitrary-hostname>' http://<vulnerable-service>:8080
```
