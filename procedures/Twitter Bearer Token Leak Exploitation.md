Once an attacker has a valid Bearer Token, they can use it to make requests to the Twitter API on behalf of the developer acc

## Description

# Description

Twitter Bearer Token Leak Exploitation is an attack where an attacker gains access to a Twitter developer account's Bearer Token, which is used to authenticate API requests. Once an attacker has a valid Bearer Token, they can use it to make requests to the Twitter API on behalf of the developer account. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as private messages, user data, and more. From a technical standpoint, this attack involves exploiting a vulnerability in the Twitter developer account's security posture. From a business perspective, this attack can result in reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and financial losses.

 

## Requirements

1. Valid Twitter developer account's Bearer Token

 

## Defense

1. Twitter developer accounts should regularly rotate their Bearer Tokens to prevent them from being used in unauthorized API requests

1. Twitter developer accounts should also ensure that their Bearer Tokens are stored securely and are not exposed in any way

1. Organizations should monitor their Twitter developer accounts for any suspicious activity, such as unusual API requests or changes to account settings

 

## Objectives

1. To gain unauthorized access to a Twitter developer account's sensitive information

1. To cause reputational damage to the targeted organization

1. To cause financial losses to the targeted organization

 

# Instructions

1. Copy and paste the following cURL command into a terminal:

 



**Code**: [[curl --request GET --url https://api.twitter.com/1]]



> This cURL command makes a GET request to the Twitter API endpoint 'account_activity/all/subscriptions/count.json' using the valid Bearer Token obtained by the attacker. If the request is successful, the response will contain the count of all subscriptions associated with the authenticated account.



**Command** ([[Get Twitter Account Activity Subscription Count]]):

```bash
curl --request GET --url https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account_activity/all/subscriptions/count.json --header 'authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
```
