# Exploit a Web App's SQL Injection Vulnerability (SQLMap)

**Status**: ✓ Verified

## Summary

SQLMap can be used to automate SQL injection attacks against web applications. After identifying a POST or GET request with potentially vulnerable parameters using Burp, SQLMap can enumerate each parameter with various tests and report on the results. 

## Description

# Description

SQLMap can be used to automate SQL injection attacks against web applications. After identifying a POST or GET request with potentially vulnerable parameters using Burp, SQLMap can enumerate each parameter with various tests and report on the results.

# Instructions

While it is possible to run SQLMap with arguments (cookies, query url, etc), it is often easier to generate a valid query with a web browser (which does not trigger a SQL injection error), intercept it with Burp Suite, save the request to disk, then run SQLMap with the request.

1. After identifying an application vulnerable to SQL injection, make a web request to the vulnerable page, without actually triggering the injection. It is important <u>not</u> to trigger the injection itself when generating the request.

2. Find the request in Burp Suite's Proxy > HTTP History.

3. Right click  in the Request window containing the query, then select `Copy to file` and save it.

4. Run SQLMap using the saved request.

**Command** ([[SQLMap Dump a SQL Database By Exploiting a SQL Injection]]):

```bash
sqlmap -r web-request --dump
```
