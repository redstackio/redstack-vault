## Description

# Description

The CVE-2012-0056 (Mempodipper) exploit is a kernel vulnerability that allows a local user to escalate privileges on a Linux system. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain root access to the target system. This exploit works by exploiting a race condition in the way that the Linux kernel handles memory mapping, which can be used to overwrite kernel memory and execute arbitrary code. This technique is commonly used by attackers to gain persistence on a compromised system.

 

## Requirements

1. Local access to the target system

1. Access to a vulnerable Linux kernel version

 

## Defense

1. Regularly update the Linux kernel to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities

1. Implement access controls and privilege separation to limit the impact of a successful exploit

1. Monitor system logs and network traffic for signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity

 

## Objectives

1. Gain root access on a Linux system

1. Escalate privileges from a low privileged user to root

 

# Instructions

1. To use this exploit, first download the exploit code from the provided URL. Then, execute the exploit code on a system running Linux kernel version 2.6.39 through 3.2.2 on either Gentoo or Ubuntu x86/x64. This will allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the target system.

> This exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Linux kernel to gain elevated privileges on a target system. The vulnerability exists in versions 2.6.39 through 3.2.2 of the kernel on Gentoo and Ubuntu x86/x64 systems. By executing the exploit code, an attacker can gain access to sensitive information or perform malicious actions on the target system.
