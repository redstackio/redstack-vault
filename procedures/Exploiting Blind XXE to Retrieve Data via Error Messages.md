# Exploiting Blind XXE to Retrieve Data via Error Messages

**Status**: ✓ Verified

## Summary

XXE can be performed by manipulating the XML request and adding an external entity. Blind XXE can be performed by referring a non-existent file and generating an error message with sensitive information like including a file from the server. 

## Description

# Description

XXE can be performed by manipulating the XML request and adding an external entity. Blind XXE can be performed by referring a non-existent file and generating an error message with sensitive information like including a file from the server.

# Procedure

1. Visit the product page and click on Check stock option. Intercept the request in Burp and send it to repeater.

2. Save the below malicious DTD in the exploit server.

*`<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`
 `<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'file:///invalid/%file;'>">`
 `%eval;`
 `*%exfil;`

3. When imported, this page will read the contents of `/etc/passwd` into the `file` entity, and then try to use that entity in a file path. Click "View exploit" and take a note of the URL for your malicious DTD.

4. Add the external entity definition between the XML declaration and stockCheck element in the request that is sent to repeater in step 1. The response contains the included local file.
