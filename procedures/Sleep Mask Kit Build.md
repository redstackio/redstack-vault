## Description

# Description

The Sleep Mask Kit Build is a Cobalt Strike kit that allows for the creation of obfuscated files and scripts. This kit can be used to evade detection by security tools and bypass security measures. The kit is designed to be used by threat actors in order to gain unauthorized access to a target system. The kit is highly technical and requires knowledge of scripting and file obfuscation techniques. The business value of this kit is that it allows for stealthy and undetected access to a target system, which can be used for data exfiltration, lateral movement, or other malicious purposes.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to a system with Cobalt Strike installed

1. Knowledge of scripting and file obfuscation techniques

 

## Defense

1. Regularly update and patch systems to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by this type of attack

1. Use security tools that can detect and block obfuscated files and scripts

1. Implement access controls and monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized access to systems

 

## Objectives

1. To create obfuscated files and scripts for use in a Cobalt Strike attack

1. To evade detection by security tools and bypass security measures

1. To gain unauthorized access to a target system

 

# Instructions

1. To build the project using the provided build script, navigate to the project directory and run the following command: ./build.sh

 



**Code**: [[build.sh]]



> The build script is a pre-written command sequence that automates the build process for the project. This script may include compiling source code, linking libraries, and generating executable files. The script may also include additional options and arguments to customize the build process. By running the build script, the user can build the project without manually executing each command individually.



**Command** ([[Build Script]]):

```bash
build.sh
```



2. To use this command, navigate to the directory where the build.bat file is located and run the command.

 



**Code**: [[build.bat]]



> This command is used to build a project or application using the build.bat file. The build.bat file contains instructions for building the project or application, such as compiling source code and linking object files. This command is typically used by developers and software engineers to automate the build process and ensure that the project or application is built correctly and consistently.



**Command** ([[Build Project]]):

```bash
build.bat
```
