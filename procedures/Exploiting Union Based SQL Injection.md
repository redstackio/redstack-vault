# Exploiting Union Based SQL Injection

## Summary

Before performing union based SQL injection, attacker should have knowledge on the number of columns in the table. Order by statement can be used to identify the number of columns. After knowing the columns attacker should craft payload using the union statement. 

## Description

# Description

Before performing union based SQL injection, attacker should have knowledge on the number of columns in the table. *Order by* statement can be used to identify the number of columns. After knowing the columns attacker should craft payload using the union statement.

# Instructions

1. Using *order by* statement to identify number of columns, an error message is observed when the column number is set to 7. It can be assumed that the number of columns in the table are 6.

2. As there are 6 columns, *union select* statement is created with 6 fields and is injected in the search field to load the details of current user.

*test' and 1=0 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, CURRENT_USER #*

3. The payload can also be modified to load the database version details.

*test' and 1=0 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, @@version #*
