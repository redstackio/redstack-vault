# Description

Kernel exploits are a common method of escalating privileges on a Linux system. Attackers can use these exploits to gain root access, allowing them to execute any command or access any file on the system. Exploits are typically used after the attacker has gained initial access to the system, and can be used to bypass security controls and gain access to sensitive data. Technical details on how kernel exploits work can be found in various online resources.

## Requirements

1. Access to a vulnerable Linux system

1. Knowledge of the target system's kernel version and distribution

1. Exploit code or tool for the specific kernel version and distribution

## Defense

1. Regularly update the Linux kernel and associated packages to patch known vulnerabilities

1. Implement access controls and least privilege principles to limit the impact of a successful exploit

1. Monitor system logs and network traffic for signs of exploitation

## Objectives

1. Gain root access on a Linux system

1. Bypass security controls and gain access to sensitive data

# Instructions

1. To search for more exploits, replace 'linux kernel centos' with a specific keyword or phrase related to the exploit you are searching for.

**Code**: [[searchsploit -w linux kernel centos]]

> This command uses the searchsploit tool to search for exploits related to the Linux kernel on CentOS. The '-w' flag specifies to search for exact matches of the keyword, in this case 'linux kernel centos'. The output will list known exploits that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel on CentOS. To find more exploits, replace the search keyword with a specific keyword or phrase related to the exploit you are searching for.

2. Run the following command in the terminal:

**Code**: [[uname -a]]

> This command will display detailed information about the system's kernel version, release date, and operating system. This information is useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities or exploits that may be specific to the particular version of the kernel or operating system being used.

**Command** ([[System Information]]):

```bash
uname -a
```
