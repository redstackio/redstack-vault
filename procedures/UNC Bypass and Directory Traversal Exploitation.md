# Description

UNC Bypass and Directory Traversal are techniques used by attackers to access files on a target system that they wouldn't normally have access to. An attacker can inject a Windows UNC share ('\\UNC\share\name') into a software system to potentially redirect access to an unintended location or arbitrary file. This technique can be used to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. The attacker can use this technique to discover files and directories on the target system, modify file and directory permissions, and obfuscate files or information to evade detection. This technique can be used to gain access to sensitive data, such as passwords, financial information, or intellectual property, and can result in significant financial and reputational damage to the victim organization.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to the target system

1. Ability to inject a Windows UNC share into a software system

 

## Defense

1. Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data

1. Regularly review and modify file and directory permissions to ensure they are appropriate and secure

1. Use anti-virus and anti-malware software to detect and prevent obfuscated files or information

 

## Objectives

1. Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data

1. Bypass access controls

1. Evade detection

 

# Instructions

1. Invoke-Expression "cmd.exe /C type \\"\\\\localhost\\c$\\windows\\win.ini\\\""

 



**Code**: [[\\localhost\c$\windows\win.ini]]



> This command uses the Invoke-Expression cmdlet to execute a command that reads the contents of the Windows win.ini file. The file is accessed using a Windows UNC share ('\\localhost\c$\windows\win.ini').
