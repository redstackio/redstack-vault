# MYSQL Injection Exploitation

## Summary

MYSQL Injection is a type of SQL injection attack that targets the MYSQL database management system. This procedure is designed to exploit MYSQL fast by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the Aggregate JSON Arrays and Concatenation of Grouped Data commands. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, 

## Description

# Description

MYSQL Injection is a type of SQL injection attack that targets the MYSQL database management system. This procedure is designed to exploit MYSQL fast by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the Aggregate JSON Arrays and Concatenation of Grouped Data commands. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands and gain unauthorized access to the database. This can lead to data theft, modification, or destruction, as well as other malicious activities. The technical explanation of this procedure involves crafting malicious SQL queries that exploit the vulnerabilities present in the MYSQL database. The business value of this procedure is that it can be used to gain access to sensitive data, such as customer information, financial records, and intellectual property.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to the MYSQL database

1. Knowledge of the Aggregate JSON Arrays and Concatenation of Grouped Data commands

 

## Defense

1. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks

1. Implement strict access control policies to limit database access

1. Regularly monitor the database for suspicious activity

 

## Objectives

1. Gain unauthorized access to the MYSQL database

1. Execute arbitrary SQL commands

1. Steal, modify, or destroy data

 

# Instructions

1. To ensure compatibility and proper functioning, this application requires MySQL version 5.7.22 or higher.

 



**Code**: [[MySQL &gt;= 5.7.22]]



> MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. The version requirement of 5.7.22 or higher is necessary to ensure that the application can utilize the latest features and security updates provided by MySQL. Please ensure that your MySQL installation meets this requirement before proceeding with the installation of this application.



**Command** ([[MySQL version check]]):

```bash
mysql --version
```



2. json_arrayagg() function to aggregate multiple JSON arrays into a single JSON array.

 



**Code**: [[json_arrayagg()]]



> The json_arrayagg() function is an aggregate function that concatenates multiple JSON arrays into a single JSON array. This function can be used in SELECT statements to retrieve a single JSON array that contains all the JSON arrays in a table. The function takes no arguments and returns a JSON array.



**Command** ([[Creating a JSON array with json_arrayagg()]]):

```bash
SELECT json_arrayagg(name) FROM users;
```



3. Use the GROUP_CONCAT() function to concatenate the values of a column for each group in a GROUP BY clause.

 



**Code**: [[group_concat()]]



> The GROUP_CONCAT() function is used to concatenate values of a column from multiple rows into a single string. It is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause, as it allows you to concatenate values for each group separately. The function takes an optional separator argument, which is used to separate the concatenated values. If no separator is specified, a comma is used by default. For example, if you have a table of customer orders and you want to concatenate the product names for each customer, you could use the following query:

SELECT customer_id, GROUP_CONCAT(product_name) AS products_ordered
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
