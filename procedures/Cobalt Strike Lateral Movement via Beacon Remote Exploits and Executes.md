## Description

# Description

Cobalt Strike is a popular post-exploitation tool used by attackers to move laterally within a network. The Beacon Remote Exploits and Executes command is used to exploit vulnerabilities on remote systems and execute code. This allows an attacker to gain access to additional systems and expand their control within the network. From there, they can move laterally to more critical systems and steal sensitive data.

From a technical perspective, the Beacon Remote Exploits and Executes command allows an attacker to leverage known vulnerabilities in software running on a compromised system to execute code on a remote system. This is done by first compromising a system and installing a Beacon payload. The attacker can then use the Beacon to scan the network for vulnerable systems and exploit those vulnerabilities to gain access to them.

The business value of this attack is that it allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive data and systems within a network. This can lead to data theft, financial loss, and reputational damage for the targeted organization.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to a compromised system with a Beacon payload installed

1. Knowledge of vulnerabilities in software running on remote systems

 

## Defense

1. Regularly patch and update software to mitigate known vulnerabilities

1. Implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement within the network

1. Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and respond to suspicious activity

 

## Objectives

1. Gain access to additional systems within the network

1. Move laterally to more critical systems

1. Steal sensitive data

 

# Instructions

1. This command provides a list of remote exploits and execute methods for Beacon. To use, simply type the command followed by the appropriate arguments. For the 'jump' command, specify the module, target, and listener. For the 'remote-exec' command, specify the module, target, and command to be executed. For more information on each method, refer to the descriptions provided in the command output.

 



**Code**: [[Beacon Remote Exploits
======================
jump]]



> The 'jump' command allows the user to execute a payload on a remote system using a variety of methods such as psexec, psexec64, psexec_psh, winrm, or winrm64. The 'remote-exec' command allows the user to execute a command on a remote system using methods such as psexec, winrm, or wmi. It is recommended to use the 'spawnto' command to change the process Beacon will launch for its post-exploitation jobs in order to maintain OPSEC.



**Command** ([[Jump Command]]):

```bash
jump [module] [target] [listener]
```





**Command** ([[Remote Execute Methods]]):

```bash
remote-exec [module] [target] [command]
```
