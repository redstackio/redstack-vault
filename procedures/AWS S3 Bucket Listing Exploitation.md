# Description

This procedure involves exploiting a misconfigured AWS S3 bucket access control list (ACL) to list the contents of a restricted resource. An attacker can use this technique to gain access to sensitive information such as customer data, intellectual property, or other confidential information. The attacker can leverage this information for financial gain or to launch further attacks against the organization.

To perform this attack, the attacker must first identify a misconfigured S3 bucket. Once identified, the attacker can use the 'List S3 Bucket Contents' command to list the contents of the bucket. This technique can be automated to scan for multiple S3 buckets and can be included in a larger attack chain to escalate privileges and gain further access within the target environment.

Business value: This attack can have severe consequences for an organization, including loss of customer trust, regulatory fines, and legal action. It is important for organizations to properly configure access controls for their cloud resources to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks.

## Requirements

1. Valid AWS credentials with permissions to access S3 buckets

1. Access to the internet to communicate with the AWS API

## Defense

1. Properly configure access controls for AWS S3 buckets to prevent unauthorized access

1. Implement network segmentation to limit access to S3 buckets

1. Regularly audit AWS permissions and access controls to identify misconfigurations and unauthorized access attempts

## Objectives

1. List the contents of a restricted AWS S3 bucket

1. Gain access to sensitive information stored in the S3 bucket

# Instructions

1. To list the contents of an S3 bucket, use the following command:

The 'aws s3 ls' command is used to list the contents of an S3 bucket. In this example, we are using the '--profile' option to specify the AWS profile to use. If no profile is specified, the default profile will be used. The output of this command will be a list of objects in the specified bucket, along with their sizes and last modified dates.

**Command** ([[List S3 Buckets]]):

```bash
aws s3 ls --profile example_profile
```
