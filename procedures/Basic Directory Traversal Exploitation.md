## Description

# Description

Directory Traversal is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the web root folder. Basic directory traversal exploitation involves the use of directory traversal sequences to navigate to the parent directory and access files or directories outside of the web root folder. This technique can be used to access sensitive information such as configuration files, user credentials, or other sensitive data. An attacker can use this technique to gain unauthorized access to a system, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious activities.

## Requirements

1. Access to a vulnerable web application

## Defense

1. Implement input validation to prevent directory traversal attacks

1. Restrict access to sensitive files and directories

1. Monitor web application logs for suspicious activity

## Objectives

1. Gain unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories

1. Escalate privileges

1. Perform other malicious activities

# Instructions

1. 

**Code**: [[..]]

> 

2. To use these sequences, an attacker can append them to the URL or input field in the vulnerable web application. For example, if the vulnerable application has a parameter called 'file', an attacker can append the directory traversal sequence to the parameter like this: 'http://vulnerable.com/index.php?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\windows\system32\cmd.exe'. This would allow the attacker to access the cmd.exe file outside of the web root folder.

**Code**: [[../
..\
..\/
%2e%2e%2f
%252e%252e%252f
%c0%ae%c0%a]]

> The '..' sequence represents the parent directory, while '../' represents the parent directory and the current directory. The '%2e%2e%2f' and '%252e%252e%252f' sequences are URL encoded versions of the '../' sequence. The '%c0%ae%c0%ae%c0%af' sequence is a Unicode encoded version of the '../' sequence. The '%uff0e%uff0e%u2215' and '%uff0e%uff0e%u2216' sequences are full-width Unicode encoded versions of the '../' sequence.
