# Exploiting Time-Based SQL Injection

**Status**: ✓ Verified

## Summary

An attacker will inject SQL queries through user input fields or parameters in the URL to execute them on the database and extract sensitive information. In Time-Based SQL injection, attacker will use a conditional query along with a time statement to predict the information in the database. Follow

## Description

# Description



An attacker will inject SQL queries through user input fields or parameters in the URL to execute them on the database and extract sensitive information. In Time-Based SQL injection, attacker will use a conditional query along with a time statement to predict the information in the database. Following similar payloads can be used to perform Time-Based SQL injection.



# Instructions



1. In the below payload, “if” condition checks whether the current user of the database is “root@localhost” and if the condition is true, the application will load with a delay of 5 seconds as specified in the payload or it will load immediately.



*test' or if(CURRENT_USER='root@localhost',sleep(5),NULL)=0 #*

2. The application executes the injected payload  with delayed response  (highlighted in the below image )

3. This delayed response confirms that the database is running as user "root@localhost"
