## Description

# Description

Directory traversal is a type of attack where an attacker can access files outside of the web root folder. This can be done by manipulating input parameters that are used to access files. By using semi-colon as a bypass, an attacker can easily access sensitive files. This technique is often used to gain access to configuration files, password files, or other sensitive data. This attack can be used to gain access to an organization's confidential information.

To execute this attack, the attacker needs to have access to a vulnerable application. The attacker can then manipulate the input parameters to access sensitive files. This technique can be automated using scripts or tools. The attacker can then use the information obtained to further compromise the target system.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to a vulnerable application

 

## Defense

1. Input validation should be implemented to prevent directory traversal attacks

1. Access controls should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive files

1. Web server configurations should be hardened to prevent directory traversal attacks

 

## Objectives

1. Gain access to sensitive files outside of the web root folder

1. Obtain confidential information

 

# Instructions

1. Execute the following command:

 



**Code**: [[..;/
http://domain.tld/page.jsp?include=..;/..;/se]]



> The attacker can use this command to exploit a directory traversal vulnerability with semi-colon bypass. The command uses the vulnerable parameter 'include' to access sensitive files outside of the web root folder. The attacker can modify the file path to access different files. The output will be the contents of the sensitive file.
