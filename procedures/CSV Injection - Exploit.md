# CSV Injection - Exploit

## Summary

CSV Injection is an attack technique used to exploit the vulnerability in a spreadsheet application that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the target system. The attacker can inject malicious code into a CSV file, which will execute when the file is opened in a spreadsheet

## Description

# Description

CSV Injection is an attack technique used to exploit the vulnerability in a spreadsheet application that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the target system. The attacker can inject malicious code into a CSV file, which will execute when the file is opened in a spreadsheet application. This technique can be used to steal sensitive data, install malware, or gain unauthorized access to the target system.

Technical Explanation: An attacker can exploit CSV Injection by inserting special characters into a CSV file. These special characters can be used to execute commands on the target system. For example, an attacker could insert the formula '=cmd|' /C calc' into a CSV file. When the file is opened in a spreadsheet application, the formula will execute the 'calc' command on the target system.

Business Value: CSV Injection can be used to steal sensitive data such as financial records, personal information, and login credentials. It can also be used to install malware on the target system, which can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.

## Requirements

1. Access to a vulnerable spreadsheet application.

1. The ability to inject malicious code into a CSV file.

## Defense

1. Sanitize user input to prevent special characters from being inserted into CSV files.

1. Use a secure spreadsheet application that does not allow the execution of arbitrary commands or code.

1. Educate users on the risks of opening CSV files from untrusted sources.

## Objectives

1. To exploit the vulnerability in a spreadsheet application that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the target system.

1. To steal sensitive data, install malware, or gain unauthorized access to the target system.

# Instructions

1. To use this payload, insert it into a CSV file and open the file in a spreadsheet application. The payload will execute when the file is opened.

**Code**: [[=
+
–
@]]

> The payload uses special characters to execute commands on the target system. The '=' character is used to start a formula, the '@' character is used to suppress errors, and the '+' and '-' characters are used to concatenate and subtract values.
