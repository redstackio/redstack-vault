# Description

WordFence is a popular web application firewall (WAF) used to protect websites from various attacks. However, this procedure demonstrates how an attacker can bypass the WordFence WAF by exploiting a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a data field. By injecting malicious code through the vulnerable field, the attacker can bypass the WAF and execute client-side code. This can lead to various attacks such as stealing user credentials, session hijacking, and defacing the website.

From a technical perspective, the attacker identifies the vulnerable field and injects malicious code that bypasses the WAF. This allows the attacker to execute client-side code and potentially gain access to sensitive information. The business value of this procedure is that it demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring and updating of WAFs to prevent such attacks.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to the vulnerable website

1. Knowledge of the vulnerable field

1. Ability to inject malicious code

 

## Defense

1. Regularly update the WAF to prevent known vulnerabilities

1. Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks

1. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of scripts

 

## Objectives

1. Bypass the WordFence WAF

1. Execute client-side code

1. Potentially gain access to sensitive information

 

# Instructions

1. This command is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. You should sanitize user input and encode special characters to prevent malicious code injection.

 



**Code**: [[<a href=javas&#99;ript:alert(1)>]]



> The 'data' field contains unfiltered user input which is vulnerable to XSS attacks. In the example provided, an attacker could insert a malicious script that would execute when a user clicks on the link. To prevent this, it is recommended to sanitize user input and encode special characters to prevent malicious code injection.
