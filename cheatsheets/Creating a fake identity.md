# Creating a fake identity

# Description

The main reason you would want a fake identity, is to use the internet as an anonymous person. This is recommended when doing OSINT, especially on 

targets that you would want to remain anonymous from. They should not see a penetration tester looking them up on linkedin, that tends to be a big give away.

While you create your fake identity, we suggest you don't break any laws of identity theft and keep your character fictional, with an AI generated profile image.



What we will do is offer suggestions to  what could make a fake identity successful.



The goal is to make a real person, with attributes, hobbies, goals, political standings, to make people believe you have family, or a pet dog, or friends. 

You can post a picture of four burgers on a table at burger shack and say you had a chill night with friends. It doesn't even need to be your image.

Just be careful were you obtain pictures from when you want to use them on a penetration test. They are easily identifiable.



## NOTE

Fake identities are only to be used for OSINT or social engineering infiltration techniques during a penetration test or red team engagement.

It is best you prepare these accounts prior to the penetration test and have some friends and posts for at least a couple of months prior to any engagement.



# Profile 

## Picture

Have fun with this one, you can be anyone you want. But we suggest you only use an AI generated image from:  [Generated Photots](https://generated.photos/) or ThisPersonDoesNotExist

Remember you are a professional and just trying to throw the target off your scent.



## Personal Characteristics:

Age, Sex, Race, Height, Weight and personal identifiers (tattoos) should be decided for your character.



- Pick the ones that best describe your identity



## Career

Student, Employee, Professional, Executive?



- Are you a student? or a professional? Choosing this should determine the type of photo you select, will you be holding a skateboard or wearing a suite and tie.



## Lifestyle

Outdoors, Gym, Sports, Video Games, TV, Movies, 



- This won't apply to linkedin, but could apply to other social media sites, pick your hobbies and post about them, with pictures every few days.



## Sophistication

Are you smart or are you dumb?



- Will you talk about quantum chemistry or comment on cat pictures? Make it real and believable.

## 

## Political

This depends on your country of origin.



- You can probably avoid this one for fake identities, unless the target is actively engaging in political debates, then you want to side with them to encourage a friend connection.



## Good Deeds are always REWARDED

Post about some good deeds just once, a few weeks before your pentest. When somebody scrolls down your account, the third or fourth last post will be some heartfelt post about you being a humanitarian, and not a social engineer trying to earn their trust. The heart is a soft target.



## Ideal Perception

This is what a user will see when they look at your account. Having 3 friends won't cut it, these days that's just a bot. You need 50-100 followers or connections. You can't have made your account a month ago, this is why you should make your accounts well in advance, 6 months, 1 year early, and have them ready.



You don't need 300 posts, but you need enough to give the perception of your account being real.



## Chatbots

This is the best thing you can do to save time with fake social media accounts, but making posts that don't make any sense won't help you either. So use a chatbot to just like and retweet certain topics or hashtags to make your account seem active, this will also help with followers. You should make any actual posts manually for now.
