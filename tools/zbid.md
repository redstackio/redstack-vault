## Overview

KillerBee is a Python based framework and tool set for exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Using KillerBee tools and a compatible IEEE 802.15.4 radio interface, you can eavesdrop on ZigBee networks, replay traffic, attack cryptosystems and much more. Using th

## Description

KillerBee is a Python based framework and tool set for exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Using KillerBee tools and a compatible IEEE 802.15.4 radio interface, you can eavesdrop on ZigBee networks, replay traffic, attack cryptosystems and much more. Using the KillerBee framework, you can build your own tools, implement ZigBee fuzzing, emulate and attack end-devices, routers and coordinators and much more.
