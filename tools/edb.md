## Description

A Linux equivalent of the famous Olly debugger on the Windows platform. Some of its features are:. 

Intuitive GUI interface

The usual debugging operations (step-into/step-over/run/break)

Conditional breakpoints

Debugging core is implemented as a plugin so people can have drop in replacements. Of course if a given platform has several debugging APIs available, then you may have a plugin that implements any of them.

Basic instruction analysis

View/Dump memory regions

Effective address inspection

The data dump view is tabbed, allowing you to have several views of memory open at the same time and quickly switch between them.

Importing and generation of symbol maps

Plugins
