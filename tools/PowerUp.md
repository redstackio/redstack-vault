# Description

Windows PowerShell privilege escalation enumeration tool, focused on finding vectors via common misconfigurations. Once PowerUp is loaded, the "Invoke-AllChecks" command will run all modules, then report on vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them. PowerUp has not been updated for a while, as the developers have moved onto other projects. A C# implementation is also available called "SharpUp", though it lacks many weaponized features of PowerUp.
