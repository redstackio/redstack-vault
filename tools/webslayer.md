## Description

Webslayer is a tool designed for brute forcing Web Applications, it can be used for finding resources not linked (directories, servlets, scripts,files, etc), brute force GET and POST parameters, bruteforce Forms parameters (User/Password), Fuzzing, etc. The tools has a payload generator and an easy and powerful results analyzer.You can perform attacks like:

Predictable resource locator, recursion supported (Discovery)

Login forms brute force

Session brute force

Parameter brute force

Parameter fuzzing and injection (XSS, SQL)

Basic and Ntml authentication brute forcing

Some features:

Recursion

Encodings: 15 encodings supported

Authentication: supports Ntml and Basic

Multiple payloads: you can use 2 payloads in different parts

Proxy support (authentication supported)

For predictable resource location it has: Recursion, common extensions, non standard code detection

Multiple filters for improving the performance and for producing cleaner results

Live filters

Multithreads

Session saving

Integrated browser (webKit)

Time delay between requests

Attack balancing across multiple proxies

Predefined dictionaries for predictable resource location, based on known servers
