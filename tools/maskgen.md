## Description

PACK was developed in order to aid in a password cracking competition “Crack Me If You Can” that occurred during Defcon 2010. The goal of this toolkit is to aid in preparation for the “better than bruteforce” password attacks by analyzing common ways that people create passwords. After the analysis stage, the statistical database can be used to generate attack masks for tools such as oclHashcat. NOTE: This tool itself can not crack passwords, but helps other tools crack more passwords faster.
