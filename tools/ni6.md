## Description

The SI6 Networks’ IPv6 toolkit is a set of IPv6 security assessment and trouble-shooting tools. It can be leveraged to perform security assessments of IPv6 networks, assess the resiliency of IPv6 devices by performing real-world attacks against them, and to trouble-shoot IPv6 networking problems. The tools comprising the toolkit range from packet-crafting tools to send arbitrary Neighbor Discovery packets to the most comprehensive IPv6 network scanning tool out there (our scan6 tool).Included tools:

addr6: An IPv6 address analysis and manipulation tool

flow6: A tool to perform a security asseessment of the IPv6 Flow Label

frag6: A tool to perform IPv6 fragmentation-based attacks and to perform a security assessment of a number of fragmentation-related aspects

icmp6: A tool to perform attacks based on ICMPv6 error messages

jumbo6: A tool to assess potential flaws in the handling of IPv6 Jumbograms

na6: A tool to send arbitrary Neighbor Advertisement messages

ni6: A tool to send arbitrary ICMPv6 Node Information messages, and assess possible flaws in the processing of such packets

ns6: A tool to send arbitrary Neighbor Solicitation message

ra6: A tool to send arbitrary Router Advertisement messages

rd6: A tool to send arbitrary ICMPv6 Redirect messages

rs6: A tool to send arbitrary Router Solicitation messages

scan6: An IPv6 address scanning tool

tcp6: A tool to send arbitrary TCP segments and perform a variety of TCP- based attacks.
