## Description

Intersect 2.5 is the second major release in the project line. This release is much different from the previous,



in that it gives the user complete control over which features the Intersect script includes and lets them easily



import their own features, among other new functionality. This release focuses mainly on the individual modules(features) and the capability to generate your own customized



Intersect scripts. By using the Create.py application, the user is guided through a menu-driven process which allows



them to select which modules they would like to include, import their own custom modules and ultimately create an



Intersect script that is built around the specific modules they choose.
