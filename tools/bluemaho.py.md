## Description

BlueMaho is GUI-shell (interface) for suite of tools for testing security of bluetooth devices. It is freeware, opensource, written on python, uses wxPyhon. It can be used for testing BT-devices for known vulnerabilities and major thing to do – testing to find unknown vulns. Also it can form nice statistics.Features:

scan for devices, show advanced info, SDP records, vendor etc

track devices – show where and how much times device was seen, its name changes

loop scan – it can scan all time, showing you online devices

alerts with sound if new device found

on_new_device – you can spacify what command should it run when it founds new device

it can use separate dongles – one for scaning (loop scan) and one for running tools or exploits

send files

change name, class, mode, BD_ADDR of local HCI devices

save results in database

form nice statistics (uniq devices by day/hour, vendors, services etc)
