## Description

# Description

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software packages called containers. Using containers isolates services, allowing administrators to control inter-container communication and add a layer of security when properly configured. Docker containers share the kernel of the host operating system, making them more lightweight than traditional virtual machines. Containers are extremely versatile, as they can be built with specific very software requirements, making them not only excellent development environments, but also reliable environments for production applications and services.
