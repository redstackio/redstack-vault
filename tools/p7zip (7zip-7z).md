# Description

p7zip is a command-line port of 7-Zip for POSIX systems and Linux. It implements the popular 7-Zip compression algorithm, and if the full package is installed (p7zip-full), includes support for ZIP, ARJ, GZIP, BZIP2, TAR, CPIO, RPM, ISO, most filesystem images, and DEB format. p7zip is especially useful for decompressing ZIP archives which use a password and AES-256 encryption, as the standard "unzip" utility does not support these features.
