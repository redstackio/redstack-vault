# Description

OpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit which implements SSL/TLS network protocols and the related cryptography standards required by them. It is backed by the OpenSSL library, which is required by most Linux systems to handle cryptography in Linux/Unix, and required by most modern systems. OpenSSL includes a number of modules for various tasks, including generating public/private keys and certificates, connecting to terminals using SSL, verifying signatures, encrypting/decrypting files, and much more.
