## Description

It is a tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some  modifications; it makes possible to debug smali code step by step. Also it  makes working with app easier because of project-like files structure and  automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc. It is NOT intended  for piracy and other non-legal uses. It could be used for localizing, adding  some features or support for custom platforms and other GOOD purposes. Just try  to be fair with authors of an app, that you use and probably like.Features:



decoding resources to nearly original form (including resources.arsc, XMLs and 9.png files) and rebuilding them



smali debugging: SmaliDebugging



helping with some repetitive tasks
