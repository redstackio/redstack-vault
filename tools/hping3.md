# hping3

## Overview

hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn’t only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel

## Description

hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn’t only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features.While hping was mainly used as a security tool in the past, it can be used in many ways by people that don’t care about security to test networks and hosts. A subset of the stuff you can do using hping:



Firewall testing



Advanced port scanning



Network testing, using different protocols, TOS, fragmentation



Manual path MTU discovery



Advanced traceroute, under all the supported protocols



Remote OS fingerprinting



Remote uptime guessing



TCP/IP stacks auditing



hping can also be useful to students that are learning TCP/IP.
