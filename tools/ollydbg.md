## Description

OllyDbg is a 32-bit assembler level analysing debugger for Microsoft Windows. Emphasis on binary code analysis makes it particularly useful in cases where source is unavailable.Features:



Intuitive user interface, no cryptical commands



Code analysis – traces registers, recognizes procedures, loops, API calls, switches, tables, constants and strings



Directly loads and debugs DLLs



Object file scanning – locates routines from object files and libraries



Allows for user-defined labels, comments and function descriptions



Understands debugging information in Borland® format



Saves patches between sessions, writes them back to executable file and updates fixups



Open architecture – many third-party plugins are available



No installation – no trash in registry or system directories



Debugs multithread applications



Attaches to running programs



Configurable disassembler, supports both MASM and IDEAL formats



MMX, 3DNow! and SSE data types and instructions, including Athlon extensions



Full UNICODE support



Dynamically recognizes ASCII and UNICODE strings – also in Delphi format!



Recognizes complex code constructs, like call to jump to procedure



Decodes calls to more than 1900 standard API and 400 C functions



Gives context-sensitive help on API functions from external help file



Sets conditional, logging, memory and hardware breakpoints



Traces program execution, logs arguments of known functions



Shows fixups



Dynamically traces stack frames



Searches for imprecise commands and masked binary sequences



Searches whole allocated memory



Finds references to constant or address range



Examines and modifies memory, sets breakpoints and pauses program on-the-fly



Assembles commands into the shortest binary form



Starts from the floppy disk
