# sakis3g

## Overview

Sakis3G is a tweaked shell script which is supposed to work out-of-the-box for establishing a 3G connection with any combination of modem or operator. It automagically setups your USB or Bluetooth™ modem, and may even detect operator settings. You should try it when anything else fails.Sakis3G Home
