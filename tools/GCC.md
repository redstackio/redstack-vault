# Description

The GNU project C and C++ compiler (GCC) is used to invoke the processing, compilation, assembly and linking of software when building it from C/C++ source code. While GCC can be invoked from the command line, it is often used in conjunction with a "Makefile", which specifies the options required to build more complex programs. GCC can also be used to build libraries and kernel modules, and can cross-compile for other systems and architectures, assuming the proper supporting packages are installed.
