## Description

This package contains utilities dos2unix, unix2dos, mac2unix, unix2mac to convert the line endings of text files between UNIX (LF), DOS (CRLF) and Mac (CR) formats. Text files under Windows and DOS typically have two ASCII characters at the end of each line: CR (carriage return) followed by LF (line feed). Older Macs used just CR, while UNIX uses just LF.

This is the classic utility developed in 1989.dos2unix Homepage | Kali dos2unix Repo
