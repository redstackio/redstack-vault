## Description

# Description

TShark is a network protocol analyzer which captures packet data from a live network, or reads packets from a previously saved capture file. While it's similar to tcpdump, TShark has focuses more on summarizing traffic details for a high level view. TShark also includes the same capture filters found in tcpdump and Wireshark, allowing users to limit results to specific traffic in which they're interested. 



See Wireshark's helpful guide to capture filters for more details: [https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters)
