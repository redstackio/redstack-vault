Uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. The data itself is collected via a BloodHound ingesto

## Description

# Description

Uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. The data itself is collected via a BloodHound ingestor that outputs a .zip, which is then imported into BloodHound for analysis.

# Installation

## Install on Windows

1. BloodHound requires Java SE 11, which can be downloaded and installed here: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)



Note: Oracle requires users sign-up before downloading the Java installer. Alternatively users can avoid the sign-up requirement by downloading and extracting Java 11.0.2 manually from here: [https://jdk.java.net/archive/](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) . When manually installing Java, users must add the "JAVA_HOME" System Variable to their Windows Environment Variables, with the Value set to the base directory where Java was copied.
